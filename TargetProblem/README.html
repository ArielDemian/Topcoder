Here at [topcoder], we call a contestant a "target" if their rating is 3000 or more.
In the arena, the targets have a red icon with a small target on it.
Do you want to become a target as well?
Sure you do.
But before you get there, let's start with something easier: drawing a target.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
The target you need to draw consists of nested squares.
The innermost square is just a single '#' character.
The larger squares use alternatingly the character ' ' (space) and the character '#'.
Here is an example in which the side of the largest square is <b>n</b> = 5:
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<pre>#####
#   #
# # #
#   #
#####
</pre>
<br><br>
<br><br>
And here is an example for <b>n</b> = 9:
<br><br>
<br><br>
<pre>#########
#       #
# ##### #
# #   # #
# # # # #
# #   # #
# ##### #
#       #
#########
</pre>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
You will be given an int <b>n</b>.
Your method must return a String[] which contains a drawing of the target with side <b>n</b>.
More precisely, each element of the returned String[] must be one row of the drawing, in order.
Therefore, the returned String[] will consist of <b>n</b> elements, each with <b>n</b> characters.
(See the examples below for clarification.)
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
The value of <b>n</b> will be such that a target like the ones above can be drawn: 5, 9, 13, and so on.
Formally, <b>n</b> will be of the form 4k+1, where k is a positive integer.
